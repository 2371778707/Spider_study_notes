It's late at night and I'm all alone
My girl is out not picking up the phone
I know she'll lie to me when she gets home
Who can I trust
Who can I trust
I'm most suspicious of all my friends
Though when they say they are real just try to pretend
They disappear when the money ends
Who can I trust
Who can I trust
Baby who can I trust today
My friend or my enemy
Who can I trust in the day
Somebody's watching me
during the day and the night…the night
Somebody's watching me
when there's no way to hide…to hide
Somebody's watching me
during the day and the night…the night
Somebody's watching me
when there's no way to hide…to hide
Somebody's watching me
during the day and the night…the night
Somebody's watching me
when there's no way to hide…to hide
