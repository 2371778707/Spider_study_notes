宋：
When sun falls down I see your star is shining
When moon shows up It seem like I can hear your heart beating
黄：
When summer is gone I'll be sad and stronger
When you leave I know you've never been close to me
宋：
I hope there will be one day you finally get your dream
黄：
I know since now you're my youth my memory
I want to say good night to you
Now it's time to say goodbye
I want to say good night and see your smile
But it's time to say goodbye
