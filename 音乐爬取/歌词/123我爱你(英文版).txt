OP：北京昌禾文化
just wanna whisper to you
someone I love
can you hold me tightly now more than ever
all depends on you
you're my steering wheel
one two three I know the way you feel
I ain't tellng you
why I cook a meal
I been tryna follow you to say hello
just wanna whisper to you
someone I love
can you hold me tightly now more than ever
when I find the way to your heart
panacea
you could be my only lover
remember
looking into your eyes
gonna see your soul
I am always standing by your side
no matter day or night
raining or sunshine
humming our love song flying through the sky
just wanna whisper to you
someone I love
can you hold me tightly now more than ever
when I find the way to your heart
panacea
you could be my only lover
remember
RAP：I wanna say you are amazing
the one I try approaching
although I have little chance of meeting ya I'm waiting
so how to show my genuine concerns for ya
I gotta hold your two hands
until the big world ends
I wanna whisper to you
someone I loveggg
can you hold me tightly now more than ever
when I find the way to your heart
panacea
you could be my only lover
remember
RAP：I wanna say you are amazing
the one I try approaching
although I have little chance of meeting ya I'm waiting
so how to show my genuine concerns for ya
I gotta hold your two hands
until the big world ends
when I find the way to your heart
no matter anywhere
you could be my only lover
remember
