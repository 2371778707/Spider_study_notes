We are the one
We won't be falling down
As the sun will keep on shining
The story will keep on going
We are the one
We will be holding on
For the promise we held for life
For the people we love are leaving
Please tell my friends
We won't be falling down
As the sun will keep on shining
And the story will keep on going
Ah
We won't be falling down
As the sun will keep on shining
And the story will keep on going
Ah
We will be holding on
As the sea will rise upon
And the story will keep on going
Ah
We won't be falling down
As the sun will keep on shining
And the story will keep on going
Ah
We will be holding on
As the sea will rise upon
And the story will keep on going
